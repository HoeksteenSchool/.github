## 🌟 Why GitHub?

We believe GitHub is not just for developers — it is a modern, flexible platform for educational institutions.

At De Hoeksteen, we use GitHub to:

- 📚 Document school policies, handbooks, curriculum materials, and procedures
- 📋 Organize the work of teachers, mentors, coordinators, and administrative staff
- 🗓️ Plan and manage internal operations such as schedules, meetings, and school initiatives
- 📆 Coordinate events, student activities, and school-wide projects
- 🚀 Support collaborative projects involving both students and staff
- 💻 Promote digital literacy, transparency, and a culture of documentation across the community

GitHub enables version control, shared editing, structured collaboration, and centralized access — making it a powerful organizational tool at every level of school life.
