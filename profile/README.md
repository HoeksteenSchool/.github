- 🗓️ Plan and manage internal operations such as schedules, meetings, and school initiatives
- 📆 Coordinate events, student activities, and school-wide projects
- 🚀 Support collaborative projects involving both students and staff
- 💻 Promote digital literacy, transparency, and a culture of documentation across the community

GitHub enables version control, shared editing, structured collaboration, and centralized access — making it a powerful organizational tool at every level of school life.
